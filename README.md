# ANTLR Grammar Testing Tool
Kotlin ANTLR grammar correctness verification by comparing trees created both with ANTLR autogenerated parser and the real parser.

Input | Output
:----:|:----:
Kotlin language source code | Parsing and comparison report with ability to check out the subtrees in which the difference was found

### Workflow description
+ The `KotlinFileContext` object is created using the generated by ANTLR tool `KotlinLexer` and `KotlinParser` classes. If parsing errors are detected, no further validation occurs
+ The real AST stored in `KtFile` object is generated using [Kootstrap](https://bitbucket.org/vorpal-research/kootstrap)
+ For future analysis the resulting objects are wrapped into auxiliary wrapper classes
+ The comparison is recursive. If a difference in the subtrees is found, the information is stored as an `ComparisonError` object, and verification continues


### Comparison logic
- There are several ANTLR rules which can be considered as _redundant_. Redundant rules are created just to simplify the grammar and are skipped when verified
- Our goal is to check if the trees are homeomorphic by smoothing out vertices from the ANLTR-generated parse tree
